computational physics
====

implemented so far
-> classical scattering
-> ising model in 1d and 2d
-> molecular dynamics using the velocity verlet algorithm
-> NVT hard ball using monte carlo
-> NVT and NPT using monte carlo

to implement
-> unbrella sampling and the free energy of a polymer
-> entropic sampling, entropy of an ising model and it's free energy
-> ising in C and ising using mpi and openMP
-> differential equation solver i.e solutions to the wave equation and the heat equation
