# ---> the normal way
# we have an initial position r
# for this initial position, we measure the acceleration a
# for this acceleration, we measure the velocity, which we set initially to zero!
# now we update x using this acceleration and velocity!
# 
# ---> the RK 2/4/N way
# we measure a,b,c,d,... coefficients which are used collectively to update x, v and a!
# 
# for example : 
# mxdd = -kx
